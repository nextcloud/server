# Helper script to run the integration tests on a fresh Nextcloud server through
# Docker.
#
# The integration tests are run in its own Docker container; the grandparent
# directory of the integration tests directory (that is, the root directory of
# the Nextcloud server) is copied to the container and the integration tests are
# run inside it; in the container the configuration/data from the original
# Nextcloud server is ignored, and a new server installation is performed inside
# the container instead. Once the tests end the container is stopped.
#
# To perform its job, the script requires the "docker" command to be available.
#
# The Docker Command Line Interface (the "docker" command) requires special
# permissions to talk to the Docker daemon, and those permissions are typically
# available only to the root user. Please see the Docker documentation to find
# out how to give access to a regular user to the Docker daemon:
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/linux/linux-postinstall/
#
# Note, however, that being able to communicate with the Docker daemon is the
# same as being able to get root privileges for the system. Therefore, you must
# give access to the Docker daemon (and thus run this script as) ONLY to trusted
# and secure users:
# https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
#
# Finally, take into account that this script will automatically remove the
# Docker containers named "database-nextcloud-local-test-integration" and
# "nextcloud-local-test-integration", even if the script did not create them
# (probably you will not have containers nor images with that name, but just in
# case).

# Sets the variables that abstract the differences in command names and options
# between operating systems.

# Switches between mktemp on GNU/Linux and gmktemp on macOS.
