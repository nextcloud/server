# ‚ö†Ô∏è RoadRunner Integration - Proof of Concept

**IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER**: This is a **proof of concept** implementation that demonstrates the basic architecture for RoadRunner integration with Nextcloud. It is **NOT production-ready** and requires significant additional work.

## Current Status: EXPERIMENTAL

### ‚úÖ What Works
- Basic PSR-7 compatibility layer
- RoadRunner worker entry point structure
- Nextcloud Response to PSR-7 conversion
- Configuration framework

### ‚ùå What's Missing/Broken
- **Complete request routing integration** - Currently only returns a demo JSON response
- **Proper state reset mechanism** - The state reset is incomplete and may miss critical Nextcloud internals
- **Session management** - Worker-mode session handling needs deep Nextcloud integration
- **Authentication flow** - No proper authentication/authorization handling
- **Database connections** - Connection pooling and worker-safe DB handling
- **File handling** - Upload processing and file operations in worker mode
- **App compatibility** - Many Nextcloud apps may not work in worker mode
- **Memory management** - Proper cleanup and memory leak prevention
- **Security review** - No security audit of worker isolation

### üß™ Testing Status
- **Unit Tests**: Minimal coverage
- **Integration Tests**: None
- **Performance Tests**: Theoretical claims only
- **Production Testing**: None

## Purpose

This proof of concept addresses [GitHub Issue #36290](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues/36290) by demonstrating:

1. **Architecture feasibility** - Shows how RoadRunner could integrate with Nextcloud
2. **PSR-7 compatibility** - Provides a foundation for making Nextcloud responses PSR-7 compatible
3. **Performance potential** - Outlines the performance benefits possible with worker-based execution
4. **Implementation roadmap** - Identifies the work needed for a production implementation

## What Would Be Needed for Production

### Core Architecture Changes
1. **Complete Nextcloud bootstrap modification** for worker mode
2. **Request routing integration** with existing Nextcloud router
3. **Middleware stack compatibility** ensuring all middleware works in workers
4. **Session management overhaul** for worker-safe sessions
5. **Database connection management** with proper pooling
6. **File handling modifications** for upload processing
7. **Memory management** with proper cleanup between requests

### Testing Requirements
1. **Comprehensive unit tests** for all components
2. **Integration tests** with real Nextcloud installations
3. **Performance benchmarking** against PHP-FPM baseline
4. **App compatibility testing** with popular Nextcloud apps
5. **Security audit** of worker isolation and state management
6. **Load testing** under production conditions

### Operational Requirements
1. **Monitoring and metrics** for worker health
2. **Deployment guides** for various environments
3. **Migration documentation** from PHP-FPM
4. **Troubleshooting guides** for common issues
5. **Performance tuning documentation**

## Response to Feedback

The maintainer feedback on the PR was entirely correct:

- **"ü§®" on opcache_get_status**: The opcache handling was incorrect and has been removed
- **"OC_User is deprecated"**: Fixed to use proper `\OCP\IUserSession` interface
- **"Far from what's needed in terms of reset"**: The state reset is still incomplete and needs deep Nextcloud expertise

## How to Actually Implement This

If the Nextcloud team wanted to implement RoadRunner support properly, the recommended approach would be:

1. **Phase 1: Research**
   - Deep analysis of Nextcloud's request lifecycle
   - Identification of all stateful components
   - Performance baseline establishment

2. **Phase 2: Core Modifications**
   - Modify Nextcloud bootstrap for worker compatibility
   - Implement proper state reset mechanism
   - Create worker-safe session management

3. **Phase 3: Testing & Refinement**
   - Extensive testing with real workloads
   - Performance optimization
   - App compatibility validation

4. **Phase 4: Production Readiness**
   - Security audit
   - Documentation
   - Migration tools

## Acknowledgments

This proof of concept was created to demonstrate the architectural approach rather than provide a working implementation. The maintainer feedback highlighted the significant gaps that would need to be addressed for a production-ready solution.

The goal is to spark discussion about whether RoadRunner integration is worth the substantial engineering effort it would require.
