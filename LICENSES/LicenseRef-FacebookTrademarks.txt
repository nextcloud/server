Facebook brand resources and guidelines

The logo is our most important brand asset. We use it with consistency and intention to represent the world of social discovery to billions of people around the world.

Our Logo Evolution

Our logo has evolved over time, building on our past heritage, using an 'f' within a blue circle. The current logo has been refined in shape and color to make it more accessible and legible. Always ensure you are using the current version of our logo in any new designs or communications.
