Open source project guidelines

If you choose to build on or modify Mastodon's open-source code, beyond modifications limited to switching on or off features already included in the software, minor tweaks in visual appearance, translations into other languages, and bug fixes:

* You must choose your own branding, logos, and trademarks that denote your unique identity so as to clearly signal to users that there is no affiliation with or endorsement by Mastodon gGmbH.
* You may use word marks, but not our logos, in truthful statements that describe the relationship between your software and ours, for example "this software is derived from the source code of the Mastodon software".

Social media guidelines

The name and handle of your social media account and any and all pages cannot begin with a Mastodon word mark, or a similar mark (e.g. "mastodoon", "mast0don", "mstdn"). In addition, Mastodon logos cannot be used in a way that might suggest affiliation with or endorsement by Mastodon.
