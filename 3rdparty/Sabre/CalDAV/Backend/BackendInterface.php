    /**
     * Performs a calendar-query on the contents of this calendar.

     * The calendar-query is defined in RFC4791 : CalDAV. Using the
     * calendar-query it is possible for a client to request a specific set of
     * object, based on contents of iCalendar properties, date-ranges and
     * iCalendar component types (VTODO, VEVENT).
     *
     * This method should just return a list of (relative) urls that match this
     * query.
     *
     * The list of filters are specified as an array. The exact array is
     * documented by Sabre_CalDAV_CalendarQueryParser.
     *
     * Note that it is extremely likely that getCalendarObject for every path
     * returned from this method will be called almost immediately after. You
     * may want to anticipate this to speed up these requests.
     *
     * This method provides a default implementation, which parses *all* the
     * iCalendar objects in the specified calendar.
     *
     * This default may well be good enough for personal use, and calendars
     * that aren't very large. But if you anticipate high usage, big calendars
     * or high loads, you are strongly adviced to optimize certain paths.
     *
     * The best way to do so is override this method and to optimize
     * specifically for 'common filters'.
     *
     * Requests that are extremely common are:
     *   * requests for just VEVENTS
     *   * requests for just VTODO
     *   * requests with a time-range-filter on either VEVENT or VTODO.
     *
     * ..and combinations of these requests. It may not be worth it to try to
     * handle every possible situation and just rely on the (relatively
     * easy to use) CalendarQueryValidator to handle the rest.
     *
     * Note that especially time-range-filters may be difficult to parse. A
     * time-range filter specified on a VEVENT must for instance also handle
     * recurrence rules correctly.
     * A good example of how to interprete all these filters can also simply
     * be found in Sabre_CalDAV_CalendarQueryFilter. This class is as correct
     * as possible, so it gives you a good idea on what type of stuff you need
     * to think of.
