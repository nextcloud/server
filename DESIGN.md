# Nextcloud Design contribution guidelines

## 👋 Welcome

At Nextcloud we want to make sure to have everything in place to enable designers to contribute – making our apps universally accessible and easy to use.

## 🚢 How to contribute design

We have a dedicated page with more in-detail guidelines on our website: 
https://nextcloud.com/design/

**TL;DR**

1. Check out open [issues](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/issues) here on GitHub (we label them with `design`)
2. Make sure create publicly accessible assets 
3. Add your contributions to an issue and we promise we will review your contribution carefully and foster discussions

[This issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/issues/877) has examples of other apps, some simple mockups, and specifications about the design. In the discussions in the comments there are updates to the design as well.

[This pull request](https://github.com/nextcloud/desktop/pull/1565) by a developer has the implementation of that issue, the changes they made, and more design discussions and adjustments.

**We encourage you to:**
