 *                   native support (i.e., legacy browsers)
 * @param {boolean}  [options.preserveStatic=true] Determines if CSS

 *                   3) the source URL as arguments.
 * @param {function} [options.onComplete] Callback after all CSS has been
 *                   processed, legacy-compatible CSS has been generated, and

 *                   string with CSS variable values resolved, 2) an array of
 *                   output <style> node references that have been appended to

 * @param {function} [options.onFinally] Callback in modern and legacy browsers
 *                   after the ponyfill has finished all tasks. Passes 1) a
 *                   boolean indicating if the last ponyfill call resulted in a
 *                   style change, 2) a boolean indicating if the current
 *                   browser provides native support for CSS custom properties,
