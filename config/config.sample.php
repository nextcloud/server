 * Available failover modes:
 *  - \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_NONE - only send commands to master nodes (default)
 *  - \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_ERROR - failover to slaves for read commands if master is unavailable (recommended)
 *  - \RedisCluster::FAILOVER_DISTRIBUTE - randomly distribute read commands across master and slaves

 * is synchronized, it could happen that the read for an existing lock is
