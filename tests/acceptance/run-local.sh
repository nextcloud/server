# Helper script to run the acceptance tests, which test a running Nextcloud
# instance from the point of view of a real user, configured to start the
# Nextcloud server themselves and from their grandparent directory.
#
# The acceptance tests are written in Behat so, besides running the tests, this
# script installs Behat, its dependencies, and some related packages in the
# "vendor" subdirectory of the acceptance tests. The acceptance tests expect
# that the last commit in the Git repository provides the default state of the
# Nextcloud server, so the script installs the Nextcloud server and saves a
# snapshot of the whole grandparent directory (no .gitignore file is used) in
# the Git repository. Finally, the acceptance tests also use the Selenium server
# to control a web browser, so this script waits for the Selenium server
# (which should have been started before executing this script) to be ready
# before running the tests.
#
# By default the acceptance tests run are those for the Nextcloud server;
# acceptance tests for apps can be run by providing the
# "--acceptance-tests-dir XXX" option. When this option is used the Behat
# configuration and the Nextcloud installation script used by the acceptance
# tests for the Nextcloud server are ignored; they must be provided in the given
# acceptance tests directory. Note, however, that the context classes for the
# Nextcloud server and the core acceptance test framework classes are
# automatically loaded; there is no need to explicitly set them in the Behat
# configuration. Also, even when that option is used, the packages installed by
# this script end in the "vendor" subdirectory of the acceptance tests for the
# Nextcloud server, not in the one given in the option.

# Exit immediately on errors.
