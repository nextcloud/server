/**
 * Guid represents a UUID with "native" (little-endian) byte order
 *
 * From Wikipedia:
 *
 * > The first three fields are unsigned 32- and 16-bit integers and are subject
 * > to swapping, while the last two fields consist of uninterpreted bytes, not
 * > subject to swapping. This byte swapping applies even for versions 3, 4, and
 * > 5, where the canonical fields do not correspond to the content of the UUID.
 *
 * The first three fields of a GUID are encoded in little-endian byte order,
 * while the last three fields are in network (big-endian) byte order. This is
 * according to the history of the Microsoft definition of a GUID.
 *
 * According to the .NET Guid.ToByteArray method documentation:
 *
 * > Note that the order of bytes in the returned byte array is different from
 * > the string representation of a Guid value. The order of the beginning
 * > four-byte group and the next two two-byte groups is reversed, whereas the
 * > order of the last two-byte group and the closing six-byte group is the
 * > same.
