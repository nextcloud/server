/**
 * Base class for all PHPUnit Framework exceptions.
 *
 * Ensures that exceptions thrown during a test run do not leave stray
 * references behind.
 *
 * Every Exception contains a stack trace. Each stack frame contains the 'args'
 * of the called function. The function arguments can contain references to
 * instantiated objects. The references prevent the objects from being
 * destructed (until test results are eventually printed), so memory cannot be
 * freed up.
 *
 * With enabled process isolation, test results are serialized in the child
 * process and unserialized in the parent process. The stack trace of Exceptions
 * may contain objects that cannot be serialized or unserialized (e.g., PDO
 * connections). Unserializing user-space objects from the child process into
 * the parent would break the intended encapsulation of process isolation.
