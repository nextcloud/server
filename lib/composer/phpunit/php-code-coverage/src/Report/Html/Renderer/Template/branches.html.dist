<h4>Branches</h4>
<p>
    Below are the source code lines that represent each code branch as identified by Xdebug. Please note a branch is not
    necessarily coterminous with a line, a line may contain multiple branches and therefore show up more than once.
    Please also be aware that some branches may be implicit rather than explicit, e.g. an <code>if</code> statement
    <i>always</i> has an <code>else</code> as part of its logical flow even if you didn't write one.
