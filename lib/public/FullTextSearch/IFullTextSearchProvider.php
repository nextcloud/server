/**
 * Interface IFullTextSearchProvider
 *
 * This interface must be use when creating a Content Provider for FullTextSearch.
 *
 * A Content Provider is an extension to the FullTextSearch that will extract and
 * provide content to the FullTextSearch.
 *
 * There is no limit to the number of Content Provider that can be integrated to
 * FullTextSearch. Each Content Provider corresponding to a type of content
 * available in Nextcloud (files, bookmarks, notes, deck cards, mails, ...)
 *
 * Content is split in document identified by an ID and the ID of the Content
 * Provider. The content is indexed by a Search Platform that will returns a
 * documentId as a result on a search request.
 *
 *
 * To oversimplify the mechanism:
 *
 * - When indexing, FullTextSearch will ask for documents to every Content Provider.
 * - On search, results from the Search Platform, identified by documentId, will
 *   be improved by each relative Content Provider.
 *
 *
 * The Content Provider is a PHP class that implement this interface and is defined
 * in appinfo/info.xml of the app that contains that class:
 *
 *    <fulltextsearch>
 *      <provider>OCA\YourApp\YourContentProvider</provider>
 *    </fulltextsearch>
 *
 * Multiple Content Provider can be defined in a single app.
 *
 * @since 15.0.0
