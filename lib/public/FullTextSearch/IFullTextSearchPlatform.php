/**
 * Interface IFullTextSearchPlatform
 *
 * This interface must be use when creating a Search Platform for FullTextSearch.
 *
 * A Search Platform is an extension to the FullTextSearch that will act as a
 * a gateway between FullTextSearch and a search server (ie. ElasticSearch,
 * Solr, ...)
 *
 * Multiple Search Platform can exist at the same time in Nextcloud, however only
 * one Search Platform will be used by FullTextSearch.
 * Administrator must select at least one Search Platform to be used by
 * FullTextSearch in the admin settings page.
 *
 * The content provided by FullTextSearch comes in chunk from multiple Content
 * Provider. Each chunk is identified by the ID of the Content Provider, and the
 * ID of the document.
 *
 *
 * To oversimplify the mechanism:
 *
 * - When indexing, FullTextSearch will send providerId, documentId, content.
 * - When searching within the content of a Content Provider, identified by its
 *   providerId, FullTextSearch expect documentId as result.
 *
 *
 * The Search Platform ia a PHP class that implement this interface and is defined
 * in appinfo/info.xml of the app that contains that class:
 *
 *    <fulltextsearch>
 *      <platform>OCA\YourApp\YourSearchPlatform</platform>
 *    </fulltextsearch>
 *
 * Multiple Search Platform can be defined in a single app.
