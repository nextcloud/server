	 * find, or ideally a paginated result set where more data can be fetched on
	 * demand. To be able to tell where the next offset starts the search uses
	 * "cursors" which are a property of the last result entry. E.g. search results
	 * that show most recent entries first can look for entries older than the last
	 * one of the first result set. This approach was chosen over a numeric limit/
	 * offset approach as the offset moves as new data comes in. The cursor is
	 * resistant to these changes and will still show results without overlaps or
	 * gaps.
	 *
	 * See https://dev.to/jackmarchant/offset-and-cursor-pagination-explained-b89
	 * for the concept of cursors.

	 * Implementations that return result pages have to adhere to the limit
	 * property of a search query.
