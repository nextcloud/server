	 * to '{user} created {file1} and {file2}' and the childEvent on the return
	 * will be set, if the events have been merged.

	 * '{user} created {file1}' and the childEvent on the return will be set, if
	 * the events have been merged.
	 *
	 * The following requirements have to be met, in order to be merged:
	 * - Both events need to have the same `getApp()`
	 * - Both events must not have a message `getMessage()`
	 * - Both events need to have the same subject `getSubject()`
	 * - Both events need to have the same object type `getObjectType()`
	 * - The time difference between both events must not be bigger then 3 hours
	 * - Only up to 5 events can be merged.
	 * - All parameters apart from such starting with $mergeParameter must be
	 *   the same for both events.
	 *

	 * @param IEvent $event
