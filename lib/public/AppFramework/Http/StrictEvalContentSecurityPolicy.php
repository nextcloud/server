 * Class StrictEvalContentSecurityPolicy is a simple helper which allows applications to

 * stylesheets, images, fonts, media and connections from the same domain
 * ('self') are allowed.
 *
 * Even if a value gets modified above defaults will still get appended. Please
 * note that Nextcloud ships already with sensible defaults and those policies
 * should require no modification at all for most use-cases.
 *
 * This is a temp helper class from the default ContentSecurityPolicy to allow slow
 * migration to a stricter CSP. This does not allow unsafe eval.
