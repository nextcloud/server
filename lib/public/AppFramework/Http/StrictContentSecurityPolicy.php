 * Even if a value gets modified above defaults will still get appended. Please
 * note that Nextcloud ships already with sensible defaults and those policies
 * should require no modification at all for most use-cases.
 *
 * This class represents out strictest defaults. They may get change from release
 * to release if more strict CSP directives become available.
