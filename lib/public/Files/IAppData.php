 * Interface for accessing app-specific data storage in Nextcloud.
 *
 * Implementations of this interface provide a virtual filesystem abstraction
 * for storing application data that is isolated from user files. Each Nextcloud
 * application can store, retrieve, and manage its own data within a dedicated
 * subfolder of the instance-wide appdata directory.
 *
 * This interface extends {@see OCP\Files\SimpleFS\ISimpleRoot}, allowing
 * applications to work with files and folders using simplified filesystem
 * operations.
 *
 * Typical use cases include caching, storing previews, thumbnails, configuration,
 * or other non-user-specific data for an app.
 *
 * @since 11.0.0
