/**
 * Metadata cache for a storage
 *
 * The cache stores the metadata for all files and folders in a storage and is kept up to date through the following mechanisms:
 *
 * - Scanner: scans the storage and updates the cache where needed
 * - Watcher: checks for changes made to the filesystem outside of the Nextcloud instance and rescans files and folder when a change is detected
 * - Updater: listens to changes made to the filesystem inside of the Nextcloud instance and updates the cache where needed
 * - ChangePropagator: updates the mtime and etags of parent folders whenever a change to the cache is made to the cache by the updater
