2. 🐛 [Pick a good first issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/labels/good%20first%20issue)
3. 👩‍🔧 Create a branch and make your changes. Remember to sign off your commits using `git commit -sm "Your commit message"`
4. ⬆ Create a [pull request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) and `@mention` the people from the issue to review

Third-party components are handled as git submodules which have to be initialized first. So aside from the regular git checkout invoking `git submodule update --init` or a similar command is needed, for details see Git documentation.

Several apps that are included by default in regular releases such as [First run wizard](https://github.com/nextcloud/firstrunwizard) or [Activity](https://github.com/nextcloud/activity) are missing in `master` and have to be installed manually by cloning them into the `apps` subfolder.

Otherwise, git checkouts can be handled the same as release archives, by using the `stable*` branches. Note they should never be used on production systems.


### Tools we use 🛠

- [👀 BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) for cross-browser testing
- [🌊 WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) for accessibility testing
- [🚨 Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) for testing performance, accessibility, and more

#### Helpful bots at GitHub :robot:

- Comment on a pull request with `/update-3rdparty` to update the 3rd party submodule. It will update to the last commit of the 3rd party branch named like the PR target.
