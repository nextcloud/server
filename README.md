### Development setup 👩‍💻

1. 🚀 [Set up your local development environment](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/developer_manual/getting_started/devenv.html)
2. 🐛 [Pick a good first issue](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/labels/good%20first%20issue)
3. 👩‍🔧 Create a branch and make your changes. Remember to sign off your commits using `git commit -sm "Your commit message"`
4. ⬆ Create a [pull request](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/#opening-a-pull-request) and `@mention` the people from the issue to review
5. 👍 Fix things that come up during review
6. 🎉 Wait for it to get merged!

Third-party components are handled as git submodules which have to be initialized first. So aside from the regular git checkout invoking `git submodule update --init` or a similar command is needed, for details see Git documentation.

Several apps that are included by default in regular releases such as [First run wizard](https://github.com/nextcloud/firstrunwizard) or [Activity](https://github.com/nextcloud/activity) are missing in `master` and have to be installed manually by cloning them into the `apps` subfolder.

Otherwise, git checkouts can be handled the same as release archives, by using the `stable*` branches. Note they should never be used on production systems.

### Working with front-end code 🏗

#### Building

We are moving more and more towards using Vue.js in the frontend, starting with Settings. For building the code on changes, use these terminal commands in the root folder:

```bash
# install dependencies
make dev-setup

# build for development
make build-js

# build for development and watch edits
make watch-js

# build for production with minification
make build-js-production
```

#### Committing changes

**When making changes, also commit the compiled files!**

We still use Handlebars templates some places in Files and Settings. We will replace these step-by-step with Vue.js, but in the meantime you need to compile them separately.

If you don’t have Handlebars installed yet, you can do it with this terminal command:
```bash
sudo npm install -g handlebars
```

Then inside the root folder of your local Nextcloud development installation, run this command in the terminal every time you changed a `.handlebars` file to compile it:
```bash
./build/compile-handlebars-templates.sh
```

Before checking in JS changes, make sure to also build for production:
```bash
make build-js-production
```
Then add the compiled files for committing.

To save some time, to only rebuild for a specific app, use the following and replace the module with the app name:
```bash
MODULE=user_status make build-js-production
```

Please note that if you used `make build-js` or `make watch-js` before, you'll notice that a lot of files were marked as changed, so might need to clear the workspace first.

### Working with back-end code 🏗

When changing back-end PHP code, in general no additional steps are needed before checking in.

However, if new files were created, you will need to run the following command to update the autoloader files:
```bash
build/autoloaderchecker.sh
```

After that, please also include the autoloader file changes in your commits.

### Tools we use 🛠

- [👀 BrowserStack](https://browserstack.com) for cross-browser testing
- [🌊 WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) for accessibility testing
- [🚨 Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/) for testing of performance, accessibility and more
