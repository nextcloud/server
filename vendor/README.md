# 3rdparty

Some 3rd party libraries that are necessary to run Nextcloud.

## Updating libraries manually

1. Make sure to use the latest version of composer: `composer self-update`
2. Edit composer.json and adjust the version of the library to the one to update to. Pay attention to use the full version number (i.e. ^5.3.14).
3. Run `composer update thevendor/thelib` (replace accordingly)
4. Delete all installed dependencies with `rm -rf ./*/`
5. Run `composer install --no-dev`
6. Run `git clean -X -d -f`
7. Run `composer dump-autoload`
8. Commit all changes onto a new branch
9. You might need the following command for pushing if used as submodule: `git push git@github.com:nextcloud/3rdparty.git branchname`

### Updating polyfills

We make use of Symfony polyfills to allow us writing code already using methods from newer PHP version.
This allows cleaner code and once our minimum PHP version is bumped we have no duplicated code for those methods anymore.

To keep the list of polyfills up to date, we need to add new polyfills once a new PHP version was released,
for example with the release of PHP 8.4 we need to add its polyfills by running `composer require symfony/polyfill-php84`.

But we need to also remove unused polyfills to reduce any (minimal) overhead.
Thus once we increase our minimal PHP version we should remove the added polyfills from the list of dependencies.
Moreover also some dependencies require polyfills, to also reduce the list of added polyfills,
we add the unneeded onces to the `replace` section of the `composer.json`.

So all PHP polyfills for already supported versions should be added to that section.
But also polyfills for PHP modules that we require to be installed should be added, one example here is the `mbstring` module.
