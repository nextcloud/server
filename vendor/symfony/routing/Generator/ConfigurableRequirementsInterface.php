/**
 * ConfigurableRequirementsInterface must be implemented by URL generators that
 * can be configured whether an exception should be generated when the parameters
 * do not match the requirements. It is also possible to disable the requirements
 * check for URL generation completely.
 *
 * The possible configurations and use-cases:
 * - setStrictRequirements(true): Throw an exception for mismatching requirements. This
 *   is mostly useful in development environment.
 * - setStrictRequirements(false): Don't throw an exception but return an empty string as URL for
 *   mismatching requirements and log the problem. Useful when you cannot control all
 *   params because they come from third party libs but don't want to have a 404 in
 *   production environment. It should log the mismatch so one can review it.
 * - setStrictRequirements(null): Return the URL with the given parameters without
 *   checking the requirements at all. When generating a URL you should either trust
 *   your params or you validated them beforehand because otherwise it would break your
 *   link anyway. So in production environment you should know that params always pass
 *   the requirements. Thus this option allows to disable the check on URL generation for
 *   performance reasons (saving a preg_match for each requirement every time a URL is
 *   generated).
