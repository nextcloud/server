 * according to the implementing system and is typically passed by the
 * Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface object.
 *
 * The Cache\CacheItemInterface object encapsulates the storage and retrieval of
 * cache items. Each Cache\CacheItemInterface is generated by a
 * Cache\CacheItemPoolInterface object, which is responsible for any required
 * setup as well as associating the object with a unique Key.
 * Cache\CacheItemInterface objects MUST be able to store and retrieve any type
 * of PHP value defined in the Data section of the specification.
 *
 * Calling Libraries MUST NOT instantiate Item objects themselves. They may only
 * be requested from a Pool object via the getItem() method.  Calling Libraries
 * SHOULD NOT assume that an Item created by one Implementing Library is
 * compatible with a Pool from another Implementing Library.
