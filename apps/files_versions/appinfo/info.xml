	ownCloud supports simple version control for files.	The versioning app
	expires old versions automatically to make sure that
	the user doesn't run out of space. Following pattern is used to delete
	old versions:
	For the first 10 seconds ownCloud keeps one version every 2 seconds;
	For the first hour ownCloud keeps one version every minute;
	For the first 24 hours ownCloud keeps one version every hour;
	For the first 30 days ownCloud keeps one version every day;
	After the first 30 days ownCloud keeps one version every week.

	The versions are adjusted along this pattern every time a new version gets
	created.

	Beside that the version app takes care to never use more that 50% of the users
	currently available free space. If the stored versions exceed this limit
	ownCloud deletes the oldest versions until it meets the memory usage limit
	again.
