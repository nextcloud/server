	ownCloud keeps a copy of your deleted files in case you need them again. 
	To make sure that the user doesn't run out of memory the deleted files app
	manages the size of the deleted files for the user. By default deleted files
	stay in the trash bin for 90 days. ownCloud checks the age of the files
	every time a new files gets moved to the deleted files and remove all files
	older than 180 days. The user can adjust this value in the config.php by
	setting the "trashbin_retention_obligation" value.

	Beside that the delted files app take care to never use more that 50% of
	your currently available free space. If your deleted files exceed this limit
	ownCloud deletes the oldest versions until it meets the memory usage limit
	again.
