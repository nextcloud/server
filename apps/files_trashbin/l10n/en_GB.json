Restoring a file also restores related file versions, if the versions application is enabled. When a file is deleted from a share, it can be restored in the same manner, though it is no longer shared. By default, these files remain in the trash bin for 30 days.\nTo prevent an account from running out of disk space, the Deleted files app will not utilize more than 50% of the currently available free quota for deleted files.
