Future versions might implement additional features and services. Currently
planned are the following:

* Ability to create Shortys directly from shared files inside ownCloud
Creating a Shorty based on the public url generated for shared files works like
charm. However it is not very convenient to do that manually. It would be great
to offer that option directly where file sharing is done, in that very dialog.
However I currently do not see any means to achieve that on ownCloud. There is
no feature offered to hook additional functionality into exsiting apps.
This means either the existing file sharing app has to be modified or such a
modifying core feature has to be implemented into the ownCLoud core. 
Or maybe someone has got another idea ?

* Integrated proxy function as an alternative to forwarding:
Currently all browser requests are forwarded to the final target url, provided
that the referenced shorty is still valid and accessible. This is a simple but
effective strategy. Offering a transparent proxy service as an alternative
would greatly enhance the privacy protection, since the final target url of a
referenced web ressource would never be handed out. 

* Better, more fine grained access control:
Currently the only means of access control, apart from defining or removing a
shorty are its "status". The status can block an otherwise valid shorty from
usage from outside ownCloud, it can restrict its access to authenticated users
or it can make an existing shorty freely accessible to the public. Other
ownCloud plugins allow to define individual access to content on per-user or
per-group rules.

* Support of further backends: 
Currently the usage of six url shortener services is implemented, besides the
two private or local ones. Unfortunately three of these had to be disabled due
to stability issues. Besides correcting the implementation for the disabled it
might make sense to support further backends, especially other types besides
online services.

* Performance, stability and usability enhancements: 
"Shorty" is my first web application using up to date web technologies.
Therefore the implementation certainly is far from the quality one could expect
from a serious and experienced web developer. One could also put this into more
constructive terms: there is definately much room for enhancements   :-) 

* Translations of the shorty module itself (i18n/l10n):
Main development language is english (us), a german translation exists. I do
not feel fit enough in other languages to create a translation myself. So I
certainly welcome any assistance in that aspect. The effort consists of editing
one single file, take a look at the german example in file l10n/de.php. 

* Usage of svg icons instead of png graphics:
I created all icons in svg format. ownCloud implements a mechanism to use those
in browsers supporting svg directly. However I did not yet figure out how to
use that feature without adding too much scripting overhead. Is it possible
to reference icons the ownCloud way directly in a php based template, without
the need to explicit handling via javascript ?
I wish a better API documentation would exist for ownCloud !

* Localization for the date picker fields
Currently date inputs (expiration date) are not validated explicitly.
A number of formats work, are accepted correct, but there is no localization
of the input format to the users language.

* Integrated help button
One thing I miss throughout the ownCloud application is a context sensitive
help, or a help button at all ! Originally I planned to integrate on into this 
plugin. However I think that is more something that should be implemented as a
core feature of ownCloud. Maybe as a separate plugin (app). SOmehing like a
help framework with a documented api where other plugins (and core apps) can
attach help texts or documents to. Context sensivity would then simply mean to
update the reference in the help button for each action taken.

Contributions:
I'd be more than happy to welcome all contributions to this little experiment.
Drop me a note, an idea, a patch, a good bottle of wine, anything !
