=== Overview ===
See file README.

=== Installation ===
See file INSTALLATION.

=== Requirements ===
ownCloud version 2 or newer on the server side.
A css3 capable and reasonably standards conform web browser.
A scripting capable bookmarks feature for the optional Shortlet thing. 

=== Usage ===
This is only a very basic description. The plugin should be fairly intuitive to
use, just have a try with a few web urls. To get going I suggest that you
- chose a backend (see configuration below).
- import the shortlet into your preferred web browser (see configuration below).
- define a few shorties either manually ("New") or by using the shortlet.
All actions on existing shorties are accessed using the action icons shown to
the right of the shorty in the list. Daily uses is probably based on selection
the 'share' action and grabbing the visualized "source url".
By clicking on the header row of the list of shorties you can open (and close)
a "toolbox" offering options to sort, filter and reload the list. The sorting
you chose is stored in a persistant manner, not so any filters defined. You
cannot accidentially close the toolbox when there are still filters active. 
You can remove (delete) existing shorties, but those shorties will only be
marked as deleted. This way you can 'undelete' them if required. Permanent
removal is done next time you access the shorty plugin. If you really want to
make sure the removal is done NOW then simply reload the list. This is done in
the "toolbox" of the list (click on the header row) by chosing the "reload"
icon on the left (or by a simple browser reload). 

=== PRIVACY ===
Shorty allows you to stay more in control over links you post or send. It is up
to you to decide wether a once posted link should stay valid and usable or not.
However it is also very important to keep in mind that such form of control can
never replace any serious form of access control over the content published via
a published link. Shorty works as a short url resolver, meaning it forwards any
requesting web browser to the real address of the published content. This might
change when if future an integrated proxy function gets implemented, as opposed
to the current forwarding mechanism.
