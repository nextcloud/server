	<description>Shorty offers a service to store, manage and use a collection of short links
pointing to ressources in the web. The features are a combination of a
centralized bookmarks collection, an url shortener and an access control.
The collection is presented as a link of "shorties", a shorty can be created
either manually in the list ("New") or by using the "Shortlet". The Shortlet
is something like a Booklet, a JS based bookmark meant to be stored inside the
bookmark toolbar or area of a web browser. When clicked, the page currently
open in the browser will be offered to be added to the list of existing shorties.
