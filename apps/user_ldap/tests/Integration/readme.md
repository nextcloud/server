# Requirements #

Have (as in do copy if not already done) the following files from https://github.com/owncloud/administration/tree/master/ldap-testing copied into the directory "setup-scripts":

 * start.sh
 * stop.sh
 * config.php

Configure config.php according to your needs, also have a look into the LDAP and network settings in start.sh and stop.sh.

# Usage #

The basic command to run a test is:

```# ./run-test.sh [phpscript]```

Yes, run it as root from within this directory.

Example:

```
$ sudo ./run-test.sh lib/IntegrationTestAccessGroupsMatchFilter.php

# How it works #

1. start.sh is executed which brings up a fresh and clean OpenLDAP in Docker.
2. The provided test script is executed. It also outputs results.
3. stop.sh is executed to shut down OpenLDAP

# Beware #

This is quick solution for basically one test case. With expension this mechanism should be improved as well.

It does not run automatically, unless you do it. No integration with any testing framework.

exceptionOnLostConnection.php is not part of this mechanism. Read its source and run it isolated. While you're at it, port it :Ã¾
