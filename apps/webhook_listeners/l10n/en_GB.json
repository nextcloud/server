This approach makes it easy to connect Nextcloud \n        with external tools, allowing for real-time interactions without needing to manually check for updates or changes.\n\n        Administrators can configure webhook listeners via the app's OCS API. The app also provides a command-line tool to list \n        currently configured webhooks.
