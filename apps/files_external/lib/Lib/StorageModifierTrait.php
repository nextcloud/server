/**
 * Trait for objects that can modify StorageConfigs and wrap Storages
 *
 * When a storage implementation is being prepared for use, the StorageConfig
 * is passed through manipulateStorageConfig() to update any parameters as
 * necessary. After the storage implementation has been constructed, it is
 * passed through wrapStorage(), potentially replacing the implementation with
 * a wrapped storage that changes its behaviour.
 *
 * Certain configuration options need to be set before the implementation is
 * constructed, while others are retrieved directly from the storage
 * implementation and so need a wrapper to be modified.
