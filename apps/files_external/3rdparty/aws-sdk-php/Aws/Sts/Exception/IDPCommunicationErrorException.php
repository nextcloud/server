/**
 * The request could not be fulfilled because the non-AWS identity provider (IDP) that was asked to verify the incoming identity token could not be reached. This is often a transient error caused by network conditions. Retry the request a limited number of times so that you don&#039;t exceed the request rate. If the error persists, the non-AWS identity provider might be down or not responding.
